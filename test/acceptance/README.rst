===========================
PAAS API - Acceptance Tests
===========================
This project contains the PAAS acceptance tests (component, integration and E2E testing).
All test cases have been defined using Gherkin that it is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you
describe softwareâ€™s behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented.
Gherkin has the purpose of serving documentation of test cases.


Test case implementation has been performed using `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and
`Lettuce <http://lettuce.it/>`_.


Test environment
----------------

**Prerequisites**

- Python 2.7 or newer (2.x) (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
- virtualenv (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
- PAAS (`Download PaaS <http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/paas-manager-pegasus/downloads>`_)

**Test case execution using virtualenv**

1. Create a virtual environment somewhere *(virtualenv ~/venv)*
#. Activate the virtual environment *(source ~/venv/bin/activate)*
#. Go to *test/acceptance* folder in the project
#. Install the requirements for the acceptance tests in the virtual environment *(pip install -r requirements.txt --allow-all-external)*


Test structure and prerequisites
---------------------------------

PaaS will need to be deployed in a Fiware environment to be tested.

Acceptance tests have two type of test cases:

- **Catalog test cases**: They try to test PaaS catalog and they needn't additional prerequisites.
- **Instance test cases**: Those test cases try to test PaaS Blueprint deployment.

**NOTE**: For launching blueprints you will need the full OpenStack architecture available, the product releases 
registered in SDC and Chef-Server/Puppet-Master must be ready to install the software requested.


Configuration file
------------------
Some configuration is needed before test case execution. This configuration is set in the *properties.json* file.

All configuration values will be 'strings'.

**Environment configuration example** ::

    "paas": {
        "keystone_url": "http://130.206.80.57:4731/v2.0",
        "sdc_url": "https://130.206.81.126:8443/sdc/rest",
        "paasmanager_url": "https://130.206.81.133:8443/paasmanager/rest",
        "glance_url": "",
        "nova_url": "http://130.206.80.57:8774/v2/***************",
        "vdc": "***************",

        "tier_num_max": "1",
        "tier_num_initial": "1",

        "tier_keypair": "default",
        "tier_floatingip": "false",
        "tier_region": "Spain"
    }


Tests execution
---------------
- Go to the *test/acceptance* folder of the project if not already on it or.
- Run *lettuce_tools --tags=-skip*. This command will execute all acceptance tests (see available params with the -h option)
