Feature: Delete an instance of an environment in a tenant

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to delete an instance of an environment in a tenant
    so that I can release its resources once it is no longer used

    @happy_path @slow
    Scenario: Delete instance of an environment with one tier
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name       |
            | tiernameqa |
        And an environment has already been created with the previous tiers and data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        And an instance of the environment "nameqa" has already been created using data:
            | name           | description    |
            | instancenameqa | instancedescqa |
        When I request the deletion of the instance "instancenameqa"
        Then I receive an "OK" response with a task
        And the task ends with "SUCCESS" status
