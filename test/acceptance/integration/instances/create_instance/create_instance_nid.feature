Feature: Create an instance of an environment in a tenant

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to create instances of the environments in a tenant with NID configurations
    so that I can use them and work with them


    Scenario: Create instance of an environment with one tier without products
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name   |
            | tierqa |
        And an environment has already been created with the previous tiers and data:
            | name  | description |
            | envqa | descqa      |
        When I request the creation of an instance of the environment "envqa" using data:
            | name   | description    |
            | instqa | instancedescqa |
        Then I receive an "OK" response with a task
        And the task ends with "SUCCESS" status
        And the created instances have not NID metadata


    Scenario: Create instance of an environment with several tiers without products
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name      |
            | tierqa1   |
            | tierqa2   |
            | tierqa3   |
        And an environment has already been created with the previous tiers and data:
            | name  | description |
            | envqa | descqa      |
        When I request the creation of an instance of the environment "envqa" using data:
            | name   | description    |
            | instqa | instancedescqa |
        Then I receive an "OK" response with a task
        And the task ends with "SUCCESS" status
        And the created instances have not NID metadata


    Scenario: Create instance of an environment with one tier and one product (without nid metadata)
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And the product "testing_paas_product_no_nid" with version "0.0.1" is created in SDC
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name       | products                          |
            | tiernameqa | testing_paas_product_no_nid=0.0.1 |
        And an environment has already been created with the previous tiers and data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        When I request the creation of an instance of the environment "nameqa" using data:
            | name           | description    |
            | instancenameqa | instancedescqa |
        Then I receive an "OK" response with a task
        And the task ends with "SUCCESS" status
        And the created instances have not NID metadata


    Scenario Outline: Create instance of an environment with one tier and one product (with invalid nid metadata)
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And the product "<product>" with version "0.0.1" is created in SDC with metadatas:
            | key       | value     |
            | <nid_key> | 12invalid |
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name       | products       |
            | tiernameqa | <paas_product> |
        And an environment has already been created with the previous tiers and data:
            | name       | description |
            | <env_name> | descqa      |
        When I request the creation of an instance of the environment "<env_name>" using data:
            | name        | description    |
            | <inst_name> | instancedescqa |
        Then I receive an "OK" response with a task
        And the task ends with "SUCCESS" status
        And the created instances have not NID metadata

        Examples:
        | env_name | inst_name | product                    | nid_key   | paas_product                      |
        | envqa1   | instqa1   |testing_paas_product_no_nid | ni        | testing_paas_product_no_nid=0.0.1 |
        | envqa2   | instqa2   |testing_paas_product_no_nid | NID       | testing_paas_product_no_nid=0.0.1 |
