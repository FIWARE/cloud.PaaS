Feature: Get the instances in a tenant

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to get the list of instances in a tenant
    so that I know the instances I can work with

    @happy_path @slow
    Scenario: Get a list with just one instance with one tier
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name       |
            | tiernameqa |
        And an environment has already been created with the previous tiers and data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        And an instance of the environment "nameqa" has already been created using data:
            | name           | description    |
            | instancenameqa | instancedescqa |
        When I request the list of existing instances
        Then I receive an "OK" response with "1" item in the list
        And there is an instance in the list with "1" tier and data:
            | name           | description    |
            | instancenameqa | instancedescqa |

    Scenario: Get a list with just one instance with several tiers
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured

            | name           | description    |
            | instancenameqa | instancedescqa |
        When I request the list of existing instances
        Then I receive an "OK" response with "1" items in the list
        And there is an instance in the list with "3" tiers and data:
