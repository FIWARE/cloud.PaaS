Feature: Get the list of tiers of an abstract environment

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to get the list of tiers of an abstract environment
    so that I know the tiers my abstract environment will have when I create new instances

    @happy_path
    Scenario: Get a list of just one tier
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And an abstract environment has already been created with data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        And a tier has already been added to the abstract environment "nameqa" with data:
            | name       |
            | tiernameqa |
        When I request the list of tiers of the abstract environment "nameqa"
        Then I receive an "OK" response with "1" item in the list
        And there is a tier in the list with data:
            | name       |
            | tiernameqa |
                
    Scenario: Get an empty list of tiers
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And an abstract environment has already been created with data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        When I request the list of tiers of the abstract environment "nameqa"
        Then I receive an "OK" response with no content
                
    Scenario Outline: Get a list of just one tier with different valid data
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And an abstract environment has already been created with data:
            | name   | description |
            | <name> | descqa      |
        And a tier has already been added to the abstract environment "<name>" with data:
            | name       |
            | <tiername> |
        When I request the list of tiers of the abstract environment "<name>"
        Then I receive an "OK" response with "1" item in the list
        And there is a tier in the list with data:
            | name       |
            | <tiername> |
        
        Examples:

            | nameqa1 | a                       |
            | nameqa2 | nameqa-1                |
