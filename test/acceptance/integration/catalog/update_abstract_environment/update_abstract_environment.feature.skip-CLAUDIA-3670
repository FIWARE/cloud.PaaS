Feature: Update an abstract environment

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to update the data of an abstract environment
    so that I do not need to delete it and create it again when some change is needed

    Scenario: Update abstract environment leaving the same data
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And an abstract environment has already been created with data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        When I request the update of the abstract environment with name "nameqa" using data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        Then I receive a "No Content" response
