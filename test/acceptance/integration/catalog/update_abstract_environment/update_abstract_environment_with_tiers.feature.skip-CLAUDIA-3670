Feature: Update an abstract environment with tiers

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to update the data of an abstract environment with tiers
    so that I do not need to delete it and create it again when some change is needed

    Scenario: Update abstract environment with one tier leaving the same data
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name       |
            | tiernameqa |
        And an abstract environment has already been created with the previous tiers and data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name       |
            | tiernameqa |
        When I request the update of the abstract environment with name "nameqa" using the previous tiers and data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        Then I receive a "No Content" response
        
    Scenario: Update abstract environment without tiers to add one

            | name   | description |
