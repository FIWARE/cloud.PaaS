    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to create abstract environments with tiers
    so that I can clone them later

    Scenario: Create abstract environment with one tier
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And a list of tiers has been defined with data:
            | name       |
            | tiernameqa |
