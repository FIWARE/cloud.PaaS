Feature: Update an environment in a tenant

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to update the data of an environment in a tenant
    so that I do not need to delete it and create it again when some change is needed

    Scenario: Update environment
        Given the paas manager is up and properly configured
        And an environment has already been created with data:
            | name   | description |
            | nameqa | descqa      |
        When I request the update of the environment with name "nameqa" using data:
