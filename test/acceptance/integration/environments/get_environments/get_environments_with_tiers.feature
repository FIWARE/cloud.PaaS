Feature: Get the environments with tiers in a tenant

    As a fi-ware user
    I want to be able to get the list of environments with tiers in a tenant
    so that I know the environments I can use to create new instances 

    # IMPORTANT NOTE: These scenarios will not be executed unless the list of
    #                 environments in the tenant used for the tests is empty
