**# Welcome to Pegasus - PaaS Manager.**

Pegasus is a Java implementation of the PaaS Manager GE developed as a part of the FIWARE platform.

Pegasus orchestrates the provisioning of the required virtual resources at IaaS level and the installation and 
configuration of the whole software stack of the application, taking into account the underlying virtual 
infrastructure. It provides a flexible mechanism to perform the deployment, enabling multiple deployment 
architectures: everything in a single server, several servers, or elastic architectures based on load balancers 
and different software tiers. Pegasus is a easy way to deploy your applications in the FIWARE Cloud.
