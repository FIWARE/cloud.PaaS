FIWARE PaaS Manager - Overview
______________________________


What you get
============

The PaaS Manager GE provides a
new layer over the IaaS layer (Openstack) in the aim of easing the task of deploying applications on a Cloud infrastructure.
Therefore, it orchestrates the provisioning of the required virtual resources at IaaS level, and then, the installation and configuration
of the whole software stack of the application by the SDC GE ( (see `FIWARE SDC`_), taking into account the underlying virtual infrastructure.
It provides a flexible mechanism to perform the deployment, enabling multiple deployment architectures:
everything in a single VM or server, several VMs or servers, or elastic architectures based on load balancers and different software tiers.
