PaaS Maanger - Installation and Administration Guide
____________________________________________________


Introduction
============

This guide defines the procedure to install the different components that build
up the PaaS Manager GE, including its requirements and possible troubleshooting.

Requirements
============
In order to execute the PaaS Manager, it is needed to have previously installed the following software:
- PostgreSQL

Building instructions
=====================
The PaaS Manager is a maven application:

- Compile, launch test and build all modules

.. code::

   mvn clean install
   
- Create a zip with distribution in target/paas-manager-server-dist.zip

.. code::

   mvn assembly:assembly -DskipTests

- You can generate a rpm o debian packages (using profiles in pom)   for debian/ubuntu:

.. code::

   mvn install -Pdebian -DskipTests
        (created target/paas-manager-server-XXXXX.deb)

- for centOS:

.. code::

    mvn install -Prpm -DskipTests
        (created target/rpm/paasmanager/RPMS/noarch/paasmanager-XXXX.noarch.rpm)


Please, be aware that the supported installation method is the RPM package. If you use other method, some extra steps may be required. For example you would need to generate manually the certificate (See the section about "Configuring the HTTPS certificate" for mor information):

.. code::

   fiware-paas/bin/generateselfsigned.sh

Installation  (for CentOS)
==========================

Requirements: Install PostgreSQL
--------------------------------
The first thing is to install and configure the requirements, in this case, the postgresql

 .. code::
 
   yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-contrib

Type the following commands to install the postgresql as service and start it

.. code::

    chkconfig --add postgresql
    chkconfig postgresql on
    service postgresql initdb
    service postgresql start
    
Edit file /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf and set authentication method to md5:

.. code::

    # TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD
      "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
      local   all         all                               md5
      local   all         postgres                          md5
    # IPv4 local connections:
      host    all         all         0.0.0.0/0          md5
    
Edit file /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf and set listen addresses to 0.0.0.0:

.. code::

     listen_addresses = '0.0.0.0'
    
Reload configuration

.. code::

     service postgresql reload
    
    
Install PaaS Manager
--------------------
  
The PaaS Manager is packaged as RPM and stored in the rpm repository. Thus, the first thing to do is to create a file in /etc/yum.repos.d/fiware.repo, 
with the following content.

 .. code::
 
     [Fiware]
     name=FIWARE repository
     baseurl=http://repositories.testbed.fi-ware.eu/repo/rpm/x86_64/
     gpgcheck=0
     enabled=1
    

After that, you can install the paas manager just doing:
.. code::

    yum install paas-manager


Configuring the database
------------------------

We need to create the paasmanager database. To do that we need to connect as postgres user to the PostgreSQL
server and set the password for user postgres using alter user as below:

.. code::

    su - postgres
    postgres$ psql postgres postgres;
    psql (8.4.13)
    Type "help" for help.
    postgres=# alter user postgres with password 'postgres';
    postgres=# create database paasmanager;
    postgres=# grant all privileges on database paasmanager to postgres;
 
To create the tables in the databases, just go to 

.. code::

    cd /opt/fiware-paas/db
    su - potgres
    postgres$ psql postgres postgres;
    postgres=# \i db-initial.sql
    postgres=# \i db-changelog.sql
    exit

Configuring the HTTPS certificate
=================================

The service is configured to use HTTPS to secure the communication between clients and the server. One central point in HTTPS security is the certificate which guarantee the server identity.

Quickest solution: using a self-signed certificate
--------------------------------------------------
The service works "out of the box" against passive attacks (e.g. a sniffer) because a self-signed certificated is generated automatically when the RPM is installed. Any certificate includes a special field call "CN" (Common name) with the identity of the host: the generated certificate uses as identity the IP of the host.

The IP used in the certificate should be the public IP (i.e. the floating IP). The script which generates the certificate knows the public IP asking to an Internet service (http://ifconfig.me/ip). Usually this obtains the floating IP of the server, but of course it wont work without a direct connection to Internet.

If you need to regenerate a self-signed certificate with a different IP address (or better, a convenient configured hostname), please run:

.. code::

    /opt/fiware-paas/bin/generateselfsigned.sh myhost.mydomain.org

By the way, the self-signed certificate is at /etc/keystorejetty. This file wont be overwritten although you reinstall the package. The same way, it wont be removed automatically if you uninstall de package.

Advanced solution: using certificates signed by a CA
----------------------------------------------------

Although a self-signed certificate works against passive attack, it is not enough by itself to prevent active attacks, specifically a "man in the middle attack" where an attacker try to impersonate the server. Indeed, any browser warns user against self-signed certificates. To avoid these problems, a certificate conveniently signed by a CA may be used.

If you need a certificate signed by a CA, the more cost effective and less intrusive practice when an organization has several services is to use a wildcard certificate, that is, a common certificate among all the servers of a DNS domain. Instead of using an IP or hostname in the CN, an expression as "*.fiware.org" is used.

This solution implies:

* The service must have a DNS name in the domain specified in the wildcard certificate. For example, if the domain is "*.fiware.org" a valid name may be "paasmanager.fiware.org".
* The clients should use this hostname instead of the IP
* The file /etc/keystorejetty must be replaced with another one generated from the wildcard certificate, the corresponding private key and other certificates signing the wild certificate.

It's possible that you already have a wild certificate securing your portal, but Apache server uses a different file format. A tool is provided to import a wildcard certificate, a private key and a chain of certificates, into /etc/keystorejetty:

.. code::

    # usually, on an Apache installation, the certificate files are at /etc/ssl/private
    /opt/fiware-paas/bin/importcert.sh key.pem cert.crt chain.crt

If you have a different configuration, for example your organization has got its own PKI, please refer to: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How%2bto%2bconfigure%2bSSL

Configure Paas-manager application
----------------------------------  

Once the prerequisites are satisfied, you shall modify the context file at  /opt/fiware-paas/webapps/paasmanager.xml 

See the snipet bellow to know how it works:

.. code::

    <New id="paasmanager" class="org.eclipse.jetty.plus.jndi.Resource">
       <Arg>jdbc/paasmanager</Arg>
       <Arg>
           <New class="org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource">
               <Set name="User"> {database user} </Set>
               <Set name="Password"> {database password} </Set>
               <Set name="DatabaseName"> {database name}   </Set>
               <Set name="ServerName"> {IP database hostname} </Set>
               <Set name="PortNumber"> {port database - 5432 default}</Set>
           </New>

       </Arg>
    </New>


Configuring the PaaS Manager as service 
---------------------------------------
Once we have installed and configured the paas manager, the next step is to configure it as a service. To do that just create a file in /etc/init.d/fiware-paas
with the following content

.. code::

    #!/bin/bash
    # chkconfig: 2345 20 80
    # description: Description comes here....
    # Source function library.
    . /etc/init.d/functions
    start() {
        /opt/fiware-paas/bin/jetty.sh start
    }
    stop() {
        /opt/fiware-paas/bin/jetty.sh stop
    }
    case "$1" in 
        start)
            start
        ;;
        stop)
            stop
        ;;
        restart)
            stop
            start
        ;;
        status)
            /opt/fiware-paas/bin/jetty.sh status
        ;;
        *)
            echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|status|restart}"
    esac
    exit 0 

Now you need to execute:

.. code::

    chkconfig --add fiware-paas
    chkconfig fiware-paas on
    service fiware-paas start

Configuring the PaaS Manager in the keystone
============================================
The FIWARE keystone is a endpoint catalogue which collects all the endpoint of the different services

Sanity check procedures
=======================

Sanity check procedures
-----------------------
The Sanity Check Procedures are the steps that a System Administrator will take to verify that an installation is ready to be tested. This is therefore a preliminary set of tests to ensure that obvious or basic malfunctioning is fixed before proceeding to unit tests, integration tests and user validation.

End to End testing
------------------
Although one End to End testing must be associated to the Integration Test, we can show here a quick testing to check that everything is up and running. It involves to obtain the product information storaged in the catalogue. With it, we test that the service is running and the database configure correctly.

.. code ::

    http://{PaaSManagerIP}:{port}/paasmanager/rest

The request to test it in the testbed should be

 .. code::

     curl -v -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" -H "Content-Type: application xml" 
	 -H "Accept: application/xml" -H "X-Auth-Token: 5d035c3a29be41e0b7007383bdbbec57" 
	 -H "Tenant-Id: 60b4125450fc4a109f50357894ba2e28" 
	 -X GET " http://{PaaSManagerIP}:{port}/paasmanager/rest/catalog/org/FIWARE/environment"

Whose result is the PaaS Manager API documentation.

List of Running Processes
-------------------------
Due to the PaaS Manager basically is running over the Tomcat, the list of processes must be only the Tomcat and PostgreSQL. If we execute the following command:

.. code::

     ps -ewF | grep 'postgres\|tomcat' | grep -v grep

It should show something similar to the following:

  .. code::

    postgres  2057     1  0 30179   884   0 Nov05 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/postmaster -p 5432 -D /var/lib/pgsql/data
    postgres  2062  2057  0 27473   248   0 Nov05 ?        00:00:00 postgres: logger process
    postgres  2064  2057  0 30207   636   0 Nov05 ?        00:00:00 postgres: writer process
    postgres  2065  2057  0 27724   160   0 Nov05 ?        00:00:00 postgres: stats buffer process
    postgres  2066  2065  0 27521   204   0 Nov05 ?        00:00:00 postgres: stats collector process
    root      2481     1  0 228407 96324  0 Nov05 ?        00:03:34 /usr/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/opt/apache-tomcat-7.0.16/conf/...
    postgres  2501  2057  0 31629   560   0 Nov05 ?        00:00:01 postgres: postgres paasmanager 127.0.0.1(49303) idle
    postgres  7208  2057  0 30588  3064   0 Nov05 ?        00:00:00 postgres: postgres paasmanager 127.0.0.1(49360) idle


Network interfaces Up & Open
----------------------------
Taking into account the results of the ps commands in the previous section, we take the PID in order to know the information about the network interfaces up & open. To check the ports in use and listening, execute the command:
  
.. code::

    netstat -p -a | grep $PID/java

Where $PID is the PID of Java process obtained at the ps command described before, in the previous case 18641 tomcat and 23546 (postgresql). The expected results must be something similar to the following:

.. code::

   tcp        0      0 localhost.localdomain:8005  *:*                         LISTEN      2481/java
   tcp        0      0 *:8009                      *:*                         LISTEN      2481/java
   tcp        0      0 *:webcache                  *:*                         LISTEN      2481/java
   tcp        0      0 localhost.localdomain:49360 localhost.localdom:postgres ESTABLISHED 2481/java
   tcp        0      0 localhost.localdomain:49303 localhost.localdom:postgres ESTABLISHED 2481/java
   tcp        0      0 *:postgres                  *:*                         LISTEN      2057/postmaster
   tcp        0      0 *:postgres                  *:*                         LISTEN      2057/postmaster
   udp        0      0 localhost.localdomain:33556 localhost.localdomain:33556 ESTABLISHED 2057/postmaster

   unix       2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     8921   2057/postmaster     /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432


Databases
---------
The last step in the sanity check, once that we have identified the processes and ports is to check the different databases that have to be up and accept queries. Fort he first one, if we execute the following commands:

.. code::

    psql -U postgres -d paasmanager

For obtaining the tables in the database, just use

.. code::

    paasmanager=# \dt

     Schema|                Name                     | Type  |  Owner

    ---------+---------------------------------------+-------+----------
    public  | applicationinstance                   | tabla | postgres
    public  | applicationrelease                    | tabla | postgres
    public  | applicationrelease_applicationrelease | tabla | postgres
    public  | applicationrelease_artifact           | tabla | postgres
    ...
